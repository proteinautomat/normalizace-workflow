          REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS
          ===================

          This is an automated code review workflow.

          To complete the review:
          1. Examine the code changes in this branch
          2. Create or edit REVIEW.md with your findings:
             - Code quality assessment
             - Security concerns
             - Suggestions for improvement
          3. Commit your review:
             git add REVIEW.md
             git commit -m "review: My findings"
             git push origin HEAD

          When ready to integrate, run: workflow integrate
          INSTR_EOF

          echo "✅ Review instructions created"
          cat /tmp/review_instructions.txt

      - name: Log review completion
        run: |
          echo "✅ Code review completed"
          echo "Branch: ${{ steps.branch-info.outputs.current_branch }}"
